# simulation
#
# This package is useful to test and experiment with things that depend on random variables.
# For instance, it can help you answer the question: "How many level 1 
# creatures, on average, are necessary to kill a level 10 one?"
#
# Another interesting question: "How much should an attack range increase cost, so that it won't
# always be better to choose that over an increase in, say, attack power?" That's quite complicated.
